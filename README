This script provides the TIM command which measures execution time vim takes to execute given commands up to microsecond resolution (actual resolution depends on OS).

Example:

   TIM 2000 let x=0  " How much time is takes to do 'x=0' 20000 times ?

If first argument after TIM is a number, it is treated as repetiion count. 
If first argument is not a number, the command is executed once.

Multiple commands, separated by bars(|) can be used under TIM command:

     TIM 100 e xxx | bd  "How much time it takes 
                                  " to open and close the buffer 100 times
